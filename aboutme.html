        <h2> Hi! I'm Cherilynn Chow. </h2>
        <br>
        <p> First off, thank you for checking out my page! A little bit about me, I am a rising senior at J.R. Masterman High School in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I love being a part of my traditional Indonesian dance company. My favorite thing to do is travel, especially when I am able to try different foods!

       This is an important topic to me so I hope you were able to learn something new and find this website interesting. In middle school, someone asked me if I ate dog, and I simply laughed at the comment. Unbeknownst to me at that time, I exacerbated anti-Asian racism by passively brushing off their comment. Asians were heavily discriminated against yet they received little media coverage. In 2020, there were 3800 reported Anti-Asian hate crimes. It wasn't until people began to speak out about their experiences that these incidents of discrimination started to be on the news. After seeing no steps being taken against the increasing anti-Asian hate crimes during the coronavirus pandemic, I began to wonder why racism against Asians was normalized in society. I wanted to create something about the Stop Asian Hate movement because I wanted to help by educating people and providing ways to help.

       I am a complete beginner at computer science so this is only my second website after my personal website that I created with Girls Who Code. But hopefully, I can continue this website even after the Girls Who Code program.
